Scraping and Geocoding Project
Overview

This project automates the process of:

    Scraping names and locations from a public website.
    Fetching detailed addresses from Ratsit using the scraped names and locations.
    Geocoding the addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates using the Google Maps Geocoding API.
    Storing the final data in a JSON file (locations.json) and a CSV file (updated_dataframe_with_geocodes.csv).
